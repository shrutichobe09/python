    "1.  What is the difference between mutable and immutable types in\n",
    "    Python? Mutable type : Mutable types are objects whose content can\n",

    "Examples: Lists \\[12, 25, 33\\] Dictionaries {‘a’: 1, ‘b’: 2} Sets {14,\n",
    "26, 38}\n",
    "\n",
    "When you change a mutable object (like adding or removing items from a\n",
